## Backend Dependencies

This project uses `pip-tools` for dependency management to ensure reproducible builds and clear separation between production and development dependencies.

### Dependency Files

- `backend/requirements.in` - Production dependencies (high-level, unpinned)
- `backend/requirements-dev.in` - Development dependencies (includes production via `-r requirements.in`)
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Compiled production dependencies (pinned versions, auto-generated)
- `backend/requirements-dev.txt` - Compiled development dependencies (pinned versions, auto-generated)

### Dependency Management Workflow

#### Adding New Dependencies

1. **Production dependency**: Add to `backend/requirements.in`
2. **Development dependency**: Add to `backend/requirements-dev.in`
3. Compile the requirements: `make deps-compile`
4. Install the updated dependencies: `make deps-dev`

#### Updating Dependencies

- Update all dependencies: `make deps-upgrade`
- Update specific dependency: Edit the `.in` file and run `make deps-compile`

#### Installing Dependencies

- Production only: `make deps`
- Development (includes production): `make deps-dev`

#### Important Notes

- **Never edit** `requirements.txt` or `requirements-dev.txt` directly
- Always edit the `.in` files and recompile
- Commit both `.in` and `.txt` files to version control
- The `.txt` files ensure reproducible builds across environments

## Testing & CI/CD

This project includes comprehensive testing and continuous integration to ensure code quality and prevent deployment of broken code.

### Testing Commands

- `make test` - Run all tests
- `make test-unit` - Run only unit tests
- `make test-integration` - Run only integration tests  
- `make test-coverage` - Run tests with HTML coverage report
- `make test-ci` - Run CI-style tests (formatting, linting, and tests with coverage)

### Code Quality

- `make format` - Auto-format code with black and isort
- `make format-check` - Check formatting without making changes

### CI/CD Workflow

The project uses GitHub Actions with two workflows:

#### 1. CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
Runs on pull requests and non-main branches:
- ✅ Code formatting checks (black, isort)
- ✅ Linting (flake8)
- ✅ Backend tests with coverage
- ✅ Frontend linting and TypeScript checks

#### 2. Deploy Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
Runs on pushes to main branch:
- ✅ **Tests must pass first** - deployment fails if tests fail
- ✅ Deploys backend to Google Cloud Run
- ✅ Deploys frontend to Google Cloud Run

### Test Requirements

- All tests must pass before deployment
- Code must be properly formatted (black, isort)
- Code must pass linting (flake8)
- Maintain test coverage

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The application requires the following environment variables:

#### Backend
- `PORT`: Backend server port
- `MONGO_USER`: MongoDB username
- `MONGO_PASSWORD`: MongoDB password
- `MONGO_CLUSTER`: MongoDB cluster name
- `MONGO_APP_NAME`: MongoDB application name
- `MONGO_HOST`: MongoDB host address
- `MONGO_DB_NAME`: MongoDB database name
- `GCS_BUCKET_NAME`: Google Cloud Storage bucket name for image uploads
- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`: Path to GCP service account credentials file

#### Frontend
- `FE_PORT`: Frontend server port
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: URL for the backend API (client-facing)
- `BACKEND_URL`: URL for backend API (server-to-server, for Docker)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: Google OAuth client ID
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Google OAuth client secret
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: NextAuth secret key
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: NextAuth URL
- `NEXTAUTH_DEBUG`: Enable NextAuth debug mode (true/false)
- `UNSAFE_EVAL`: Enable unsafe-eval in CSP (true/false)
- `ENABLE_PROXY_UPLOADS`: Enable image proxy through Next.js (true/false)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- Python (v3.9+)
- Docker and docker-compose (optional)
- MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB instance)
- Google Cloud Platform account (for image uploads)

### Google Cloud Storage Setup

1. Create a Google Cloud Platform account if you don't have one
2. Create a new project or use an existing one
3. Enable the Google Cloud Storage API
4. Create a service account with Storage Admin permissions
5. Download the service account key as JSON
6. Save the key as `gcp-credentials.json` in the root directory of the project
7. Create a Cloud Storage bucket
8. Make sure the bucket has public access or configure appropriate permissions
9. Add the bucket name to your `.env` file as `GCS_BUCKET_NAME`

### Installation

#### Using Docker

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/turbulence.git
   cd turbulence
   ```

2. Set up environment variables
   - Create `.env` file in the root directory with the required variables
   - Place your `gcp-credentials.json` file in the root directory

3. Start the application
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

#### Manual Setup

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/turbulence.git
   cd turbulence
   ```

2. Set up the backend
   ```
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py
   ```

3. Set up the frontend
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

- Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the blog
- Sign in with Google to create/edit posts
- Navigate to `/edit` to create a new post
- Use the image button in the editor to upload and embed images

## Deployment

The application can be deployed to any cloud provider that supports Docker containers. The frontend and backend are containerized separately and can be deployed independently if needed.

### Production Considerations

- Set up proper environment variables for production
- Configure CORS settings in the backend for your production domain
- Set up a reverse proxy (like Nginx) for production deployments
- Configure proper MongoDB security settings
- Secure your Google Cloud Storage bucket with appropriate IAM policies
- Consider using a CDN for serving images in production
