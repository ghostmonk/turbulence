This document outlines the branch targeting conventions for development work.

name: branch_targeting
description: Standards for targeting branches during development

guidelines:
  - During active development, all feature branches, bugfix branches, and other development work should branch off of the `main` branch

examples:
  - scenario: "Feature Development"
    source_branch: "feature/new-incident-ui"
    target_branch: "main"
    description: "All feature work should target main"
    
  - scenario: "Bug Fixes"
    source_branch: "fix/incident-loading-error"
    target_branch: "main"
    description: "Bug fixes during development target main"
    
  - scenario: "Chores and Refactoring"
    source_branch: "chore/update-dependencies"
    target_branch: "main"
