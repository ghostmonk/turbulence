      1. Analyze the existing codebase structure, patterns, and conventions first.
      2. Ensure suggestions follow the same coding style, naming conventions, and architectural patterns.
      3. Use the same libraries, frameworks, and versions that are already in use.
      4. Don't introduce new dependencies or patterns unless explicitly requested.
      5. Verify that suggestions integrate with the existing components and services.
      6. Maintain consistency with the existing TypeScript/JavaScript syntax and features.
      7. Respect the existing project structure and file organization.
