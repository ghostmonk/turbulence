# PR and Branch Naming Conventions

This rule outlines the conventions for naming pull requests and branches in the IRM project.

## Pull Request Naming

Pull request titles should follow the same conventions as commit messages, as defined in our commitlint config:

1. Must start with one of these types:
   - `feat`: New feature
   - `fix`: Bug fix
   - `perf`: Performance improvement
   - `docs`: Documentation changes
   - `deps`: Dependency updates
   - `ci`: CI/CD changes
   - `refactor`: Code refactoring
   - `revert`: Reverting changes
   - `test`: Adding/updating tests
   - `chore`: Maintenance tasks

2. Format: `type: description`
   - Type must be lowercase or camelCase
   - Description should be clear and concise
   - No period at the end
   - Maximum length: 100 characters

Examples:
- ✅ `feat: add user search pagination`
- ✅ `fix: resolve null pointer in alert processing`
- ✅ `docs: update installation guide`
- ❌ `Feature: Add Search` (incorrect type case)
- ❌ `fix: bug.` (has period at end)
- ❌ `update stuff` (missing type)

## Branch Naming

When creating a new branch off of main, use the following format:
`<github_username>/<brief-explanation-of-bug-or-feature>`

Rules:
1. Must start with your GitHub username
2. Use hyphens (-) to separate words in the description
3. Keep it concise but descriptive
4. Use lowercase letters

Examples:
- ✅ `joeyorlando/fix-user-search-bug`
- ✅ `janedoe/add-pagination-feature`
- ✅ `johnsmith/update-docs`
- ❌ `fix-bug` (missing username)
- ❌ `joeyorlando/FixUserSearchBug` (incorrect case)
- ❌ `joeyorlando/fix_user_search` (uses underscores instead of hyphens)
