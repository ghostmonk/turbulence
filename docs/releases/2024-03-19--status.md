## Overview
This release introduces a post publication status system to manage post visibility and draft functionality. Posts can now be marked as published or unpublished, allowing for better content management and workflow.

## Backend Changes
- Added `is_published` field to posts
- Updated API endpoints to handle publication status
- Improved error handling and validation
- Added Pydantic models for better type safety
- Created utility functions for MongoDB-Pydantic conversions
- Enhanced error messages for better debugging
- Added validation for MongoDB ObjectId
- Improved type safety in API responses

## Frontend Changes
- Updated post creation and editing to include publication status
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Added TypeScript types for API responses
- Improved validation on the client side
- Updated error message display
- Added type safety for API requests and responses

## Breaking Changes
- All posts must now specify the `is_published` field
- API responses have been updated to include validation errors
- Frontend must handle new error response format
- MongoDB document structure has been updated
- API response format has been standardized

## Technical Details
- MongoDB schema updates required
- Pydantic model changes
- TypeScript type definitions added
- Error handling middleware updated
- Validation rules enhanced

## Migration Notes
- Existing posts will need to be updated with `is_published` field
- API clients need to be updated to handle new response format
- Frontend components need to be updated for new validation

## Performance Impact
- Minimal impact on query performance
- Slight increase in response size due to enhanced error details
- Improved type checking may reduce runtime errors

## Security Considerations
- Improved validation to prevent information leakage
- Better error handling to avoid exposing internal details
- Type safety improvements to prevent data inconsistencies
- Enhanced input validation
- Better error message sanitization

## Future Considerations
- Draft management system
- Post scheduling functionality
- Publication workflow improvements
- Enhanced validation rules
- Additional post status types
- Batch update capabilities
- Post versioning system
