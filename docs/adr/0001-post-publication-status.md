# ADR 0001: Post Publication Status Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The application needed a way to distinguish between published and unpublished posts. This was particularly important for:
1. Managing post visibility
2. Supporting draft functionality
3. Ensuring only published posts are displayed in the main feed
4. Maintaining data integrity and consistency

## Decision
We decided to implement a boolean `is_published` field on posts with the following characteristics:
- Required field when creating new posts
- Default value of `false` for new posts
- Only published posts are returned by the API endpoints
- Backfilled existing posts to have `is_published = true`

## Consequences
### Positive
- Clear separation between published and unpublished content
- Improved data consistency
- Better control over post visibility
- Simplified frontend logic by moving publication status handling to the backend
- Foundation for future editing workflow improvements

### Negative
- Required a database migration to add the new field
- Needed to backfill existing data
- Additional complexity in post creation and editing flows

## Implementation Notes
- Added `is_published` field to the Post model
- Modified API endpoints to filter by publication status
- Removed frontend publication status handling
- Backfilled existing posts to maintain compatibility
- Enhanced error handling for publication status validation
